# FCC.project.tester
**Template for doing Free Code Camp (FCC) Responsive Web Design (RWD) Projects to allow local testing**

When doing the example projects at the end of the RWD course I wanted to do them in my local dev environment to get used to using VSCode and command line git

I couldn't get the test script to work until the fourth project.

There are some undocumented requirements to getting it to work.
CC/Code Pen/whoever. If that comes to my attention I will update them.
